<h1 class="title">SPaR! (Scissors Paper and Rock)</h1>
<h2 class="title"> Game Design Document </h2>
<p class="title">by Xiaotian Ma, Kurtis Chan, and Nicholas Aloi </p>

<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p>This document describes a game called "SPaR!", which is designed to be a 2D fighting game.
    The game will employ sprite-based animation, tiled backgrounds, collision detection, physics, 
    AI, efficient memory management, render threading, and more basic 2D game techniques.
</p>

<h2>TECHNOLOGY</h2>
<p>SPaR will be developed for the Windows Platform using the McKilla's Gorilla game engine, which is a bare-bones engine developed by 
    Richard McKenna for rapid prototyping 2D games. DirectX will be used as the underlying rendering technology. XACT will be used for 
    all music and sound effects management.
</p>

<h2>BACK STORY</h2>
<p>Every year, the prestigious SPaR is held, a rock paper scissors tournament that only the masters of the art attend. This year, 
    there are six contestants fighting for the glory of being crowned the rock paper scissors world champion. Each one has unique 
    abilities and tools that will help them take on the competition. Who will come out on top and be crowned the victor?
</p>

<h2>OBJECTIVE</h2>
<p>Pick one of the six characters and fight your way through the tournament! You will face off against all of the other contestants 
    in one on one battles.
</p>

<h2>GAMEPLAY</h2>
<p>Players will be able to choose a fighter and fight a gauntlet of opposing fighters to become the best. Players will then use moves 
    based on an assigned type that counter each other. Whoever can get the other to 0 HP or has the highest life at the end of the timer 
    wins.
</p>
<p>- Explain combo scaling</p>
<p>- Explain archetype of each character / character moves in general</p>
<p>- Explain what happens when certain types of moves hit each other (including moves of the same type)</p>
